# magicUnique
A proof of concept of an algorithm to remove duplicate numbers from a vector
Method1 is my method.

PRO:
- Small memory consumption
- Keep items order
- Fast

CONS:
- Doesn't work on big integers

Remark: please note that you can tweak this algorithm and use the same idea to count the items occurences.


-- BENCH:
```
Method1 took : 29212 microsecs
Method2 took : 28242 microsecs
RESULTS ARE CONFORM
```
